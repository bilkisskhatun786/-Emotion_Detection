Project Title: Emotion Detection from Uploaded Images Using the FER-2013 Dataset

Overview
This project aims to create a web application that allows users to upload images and detect emotions using a trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model based on the FER-2013 dataset from Kaggle.

Key Components:

1.User Interface Development:

Streamlit Application:
Create a user-friendly interface for image uploads.
Ensure only image files (JPEG, PNG) can be uploaded by implementing file validation.
Provide clear instructions for users and display appropriate messages based on the upload status.

2.Facial Detection Implementation:

Image Preprocessing:
Resize the uploaded image to 48x48 pixels to match the input size of the CNN model.
Facial Detection:
Use pre-trained models like Haar Cascades or Dlibâ€™s HOG-based detector to locate faces in the image.

3.Facial Feature Extraction:

Landmark Detection:
Utilize Dlib or Mediapipe to extract facial landmarks to improve emotion classification accuracy.

4.Emotion Classification:

Dataset Preparation:
Use the FER-2013 dataset available on Kaggle. Load and preprocess images using torchvision.

Model Training:
Implement a CNN architecture suitable for emotion classification. Train and fine-tune the model with the FER-2013 dataset.

Evaluation:
After training, evaluate the model using validation datasets and compute metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

5.Integration and Testing:

Integrate the facial detection, landmark extraction, and emotion classification modules into the Streamlit app.
Perform thorough testing with various images to ensure the system works as expected.
6.Deployment:

Deploy the Streamlit app on platforms like Streamlit Sharing or Heroku for public access.

7.Ethical Considerations:

Address privacy and ethical issues regarding image uploads and emotion detection.
This outline provides a comprehensive roadmap for developing the emotion detection application using the FER-2013 dataset.
